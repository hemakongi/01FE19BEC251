In a complex digital system the hardware is typically partitioned into two parts

* Data path, which consists of the functional units where all computations are carried out.

   Typically it consists of registers,multipliers,bus,adders,multipliers,counters and other functional blocks.

* Controlcontrol path,which implements a finite state machine and provides control signals to the data path in proper sequence.
