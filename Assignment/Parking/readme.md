Parking System

here, sensor_entrance(to detect the vehicle coming in)
sensor_exit(to detect the vehicle going out)

Basically there are 2 sensors which are placed one at the entrance and another at the exit.when the vehicle is detected by the sensor the password is set and open the gate.
*If the entered password is correct the gate would open and let the vehicle in.
*If the entered password is wrong the gate remains close.
*If one vehicle which is already got inside the park will be detected by the exit sensor and another vehicle is again detected by the sensor entrance and the cycle repeats.
